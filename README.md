## Project structure

The project is structured into two main parts, a server and a client and you find them
a folder with the same name.


### Server

The server is written in `Scala` using the `Play framework`. The pre-requirements for 
starting the backend is to have java 8 and sbt installed.

To start the backend you need to navigate to the server directory and start the `sbt` 
console (run `sbt` from the shell). When the `sbt` console has loaded you can start
the server by executing the `run` command.

A more detailed description about the server is located in the readme file in the
server directory.


### Client

The client is written using `Elm`. The pre-requirements for starting the client is to
have node and npm installed.

A more detailed description about the client is located in the readme file in the
client directory.
